## Usage of Generative AI / LLMs
Generative AI can be a powerful tool for learning, developing, and debugging. However, 
it should be used thoughtfully and responsibly, not as a substitute for understanding 
or careful review.

### All Pull Request Authors Are Responsible for the Following:
* The intellectual content and overall quality of the contribution.
* Ensuring the pull request does not violate the copyright of any source material.
* Proofreading and editing any material generated by an LLM.
    * **_NOTE:_** If reviewers or project administrators observe careless copy-and-paste of 
    generative AI output (for example, including prompts or explanatory notes), the pull 
    request may be closed without further review.
* Fully testing any code proposed by an LLM to ensure correct and intended functionality.
* Including screenshots or other documentation that supports the changes in the pull request.
* Citing/crediting all individuals and tools that contributed to the creation of the pull request.
