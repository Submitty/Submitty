So, take out your notebooks because this is the time to write down some detailed paragraphs on the greatest animal in existance. One, CAT'S ARE THE CUTEST ANIMALS EVER. Their paws, their eyes, their little meows when they wake you up in the morning to find a fresh hairball. But seriously, they are ten out of ten adorable. Now lets learn some fun facts! Cats are the only animal that can't taste sweet things. That is so sad! But maybe this lead to them having a healthier diet. Another fact is that that cats can jump up to six times their length. No wonder they have nine lives!",
