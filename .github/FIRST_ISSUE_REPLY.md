Thank you for your interest in the Submitty open source project!

We encourage you to join our
[Zulip](https://submitty.org/index/contact) server
to discuss new features requests, bug reports, and technical implementation questions.

We welcome contributions from new developers!
Please read our documentation on
[how to get started with Submitty](https://submitty.org/developer/getting_started/index),
specifically our pages on
[setting up your development environment](https://submitty.org/developer/getting_started/vm_install_using_vagrant)
and
[making a pull request](https://submitty.org/developer/getting_started/make_a_pull_request).

NOTE: We do not use the Github issue 'assign' feature for first time
prospective contributors.  You do not need to be assigned to an issue
to create a pull request that will be reviewed by our team and then
merged if it appropriately resolves the issue.
