"""
This script is called via POST passing in a username and password which is
then checked against the system PAM. Depending on how PAM is configured,
you will need to give submitty_cgi user any additional permissions it needs
to access files (e.g. if using default setup, submitty_cgi needs to be in
shadow group to access /etc/shadow). The script returns with a JSON object
contained a singular key "authenticated" which is either True or False depending
on if:
- Username and Password were present in the POST payload
- PAM returns true for the authentication request
