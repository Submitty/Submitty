 * Class DatabaseFactory
 *
 * Factory class that we can use to contain the logic for what database provider and queries classes
 * we should use given some driver, so that it's not contained within Core and allows for a bit of
 * separation of concerns and smaller functions and easier unit testing around the DB infrastructure.
 *
 * When adding new drivers to the system, we should keep in mind the ways people may reference
 * what they think their driver is and how it would map to the PDO driver internally. Examples of
 * this would be that Postgresql is referred to (by PDO) as pgsql, but people generally call it
 * either postgresql or postgres so we allow for either of those to equate to pgsql to allow for
 * easier time. MySQL would additionally allow for the mapping of say mariadb or percona as
 * those are popular drop-in replacements for MySQL, but people may not realize the driver would
 * just be called mysql.
