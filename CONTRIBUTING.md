Join our public Slack channel, instructions [here](http://submitty.org/developer/)

Note:  We will not be formally ’assign’ing issues on GitHub to Summer of Code Applicants.  
(Technically you need to be a member of the Github organization to be ’assign’ed).  
But you may comment or ask questions on an issue.  
And if you think you have a solution, you can open a pull request from your fork.
