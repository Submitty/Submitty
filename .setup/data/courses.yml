# Define a list of courses to be added to the system. Any courses that are mentioned in users.yml should
# be defined below. A good primer on YAML syntax can be found at http:--docs.ansible.com-ansible-YAMLSyntax.html.
#
# The syntax for each entry is (anything marked optional can be omitted):
#
#   code: string for course should be (this should follow RPI naming convention so csci####)
#
#   instructor: string for who leads this course. This should correspond to any existing entry in users.yml
#
#   registration_sections: int for number of registration sections the course should have. Default is 10.
#
#   rotating_sections: int for number of rotating sections the course should have. Default is 5.
#
#   registered_students: int for number of students to have that are both in rotating sections and registration
#     sections. The default for this is 300.
#

#     rotating section). The default for this is 75.
#
#   no_rotating_students: int for number of students to have that are not in a rotating section (but in a registration
#     section). The default for this is 75.
#
#   unregistered_students: int for number of students to have that are not in either rotating or registration sections.
#     The default for this is 50.

#     The default is false.
#
#
#   gradeables: a list of gradeables to be used for this course. Each gradeable is defined as:
#
#     g_id: what is the id for this gradeable. This is optional for electronic gradeables and will default to the
#         filename of the gradeable_config, otherwise this is required to be defined.
#
#     g_title: [optional] what is the title for this gradeable. Defaults to a capitalized version of g_id with
#         underscores converted to spaces.
#
#     gradeable_config [optional]: what config to use out of more_autograding_examples or tutorial examples
#         for this gradeable.   this should be omitted if this is not an electronic gradeable.
#
#     sample_path [optional]: path for where to get submissions for a given gradeable. If no path is given, then
#         just use /usr/local/submitty/GIT_CHECKOUT_Submitty/more_autograding_examples/<gradeable_id>/submissions or
#         just use /usr/local/submitty/GIT_CHECKOUT_Tutorial/examples/<gradeable_id>/submissions
#
#     g_type: integer between 0-2 inclusive, where 0 is for electronic gradeable, 1 is for Checkpoint and 2 is for
#         Numeric-Text. This can be omitted if it's an electronic gradeable (as anything with gradeable_config defined
#         will always be assumed to be g_type 0).
#
#     g_instructions_url: [optional] string for URL to use as link for submission on navigation page. Defaults to .

#         Defaults to True.
#
#     g_ta_view_start_date: when are TAs allowed to view this gradeable on the navigation page (before grading has started).
#         This should be before grading start date and submission open date (if electronic gradeable). Only instructors
#         can view gradeables before this date has happened (then TAs are allowed).
#
#     g_grade_start_date: when should grading start for the gradeable
#
#     g_grade_released_date: when are the grades are going to be available to the student via interface and rainbow
#         grades. This should happen after the grading start date.
#
#     g_syllabus_bucket: [optional] what bucket should the gradeable be a part of for rainbox grades. Defaults to None.
#
#     g_min_grading_group: [optional] integer for what groups (and above) are allowed to submit grades. Defaults to 3.
#
# These next fields are only if the gradeable is of type 0 (electronic gradeable) and can be ignored otherwise):
#
#     eg_submission_open_date: Timestamp on when does the gradeable open to students for submission. Should be before
#         grading start date and submission due date, but after the TA view date.
#
#     eg_submission_due_date: Timestamp when is the due date for the gradeable. Should be after submission open date.
#
#     eg_is_repository: [optional] Boolean for if this gradeable using version control (TRUE) or not (FALSE).

#         Defaults to no limit.
#
# To make how the order of the time fields work more explicit:
# g_ta_view_start_date < eg_submission_open_date < eg_submission_due_date < g_grade_start_date < g_grade_released_date
#
#     components: this is a list of dictionaries for each component to be added for the gradeable. Each entry uses:
#
#       gc_title: string for component title.
#       gc_ta_comment: [optional] string for comment to be given to TA on grading. Only for electronic gradeables.
#       gc_student_comment: [optional] string for comment to be given to student on grade report. Only for electronic
#             gradeables.
#       gc_max_value: numeric for max value allowed for this component. If for g_type 1, can be omitted (and will
#             always be 1).
#       gc_is_text: [optional] boolean for if this is a text field or not. Only needed if gradeabe is of type
#             Numeric/Text. Defaults to FALSE. If this is true, then you do not need gc_max_value or gc_is_extra_credit.
#       gc_is_extra_credit: [optional] boolean for if this is extra credit or not. Defaults to FALSE.
#
# Any field that uses a timestamp allows for strings in four formats (if the time is omitted, it defaults to 23:59:59).
#   - YEAR-MONTH-DAY                      (Ex: 2016-10-13)
#   - YEAR-MONTH-DAY HOUR:MINUTE:SECOND   (Ex: 2016-10-13 22:45:59)
#   - (+/-)# day(s)                       (Ex: +2 days)
#   - (+/-)# day(s) at HOUR:MINUTE:SECOND (Ex: -1 day at 11:40:11)
