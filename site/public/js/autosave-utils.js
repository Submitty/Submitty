/**
 * This value will be true if autosave is enabled for this session.
 *
 * Specifically, we try to set a test value in localStorage and immediately
 * remove the test value. If all goes well, then localStorage is available and
 * we can auto-save to there. Otherwise, we simply disable auto-saving.
 *
 * In particular, setting an item can fail in one of two scenarios:
 * * The local storage quota is full
 * * The `localStorage` variable simply doesn't exist and therefore the browser doesn't support it.
 *
 * The first point isn't too relevant as we don't expect to be storing a ton of
 * data; however, Safari on iOS in Private Mode sets the quota to zero, meaning
 * that every attempt to write to localStorage will throw an exception.
 * Throwing an exception every keypress isn't great, hence the primary
 * motivation for this block here.
